/**
 * Named, enumerable tool sets an AI agent endpoint can request. Each name

 *
 * Only 'marketplace-assistant' is implemented today. The others are
 * reserved for endpoints already named in the backlog (creator co-pilot
 * drafts, moderation flags, trading proposals) so the type — and the
 * requirement that every endpoint pick one explicitly — is in place

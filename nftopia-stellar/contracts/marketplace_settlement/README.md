    duration_seconds
);

## Security Features

- **Reentrancy Protection**: Guards against reentrant calls
- **Front-Running Protection**: Commit-reveal schemes for bids
- **Atomic Swaps**: All-or-nothing transaction execution
- **Escrow Security**: Secure fund holding during settlement
- **Swap Timeouts**: Deadlines enforced against both ledger timestamps and ledger
  sequence numbers, with a per-holding escrow backstop (see below)
- **Arbitration**: Multi-signature dispute resolution

## Swap Timeouts and Mainnet Ledger Variability

Mainnet ledger close intervals vary and `env.ledger().timestamp()` reports the close
time of the current ledger rather than a real-world clock, so time-based expiry needs
more than one timestamp comparison. Every atomic swap therefore carries two deadlines:
`expires_at` (a timestamp) and `expires_at_ledger` (the ledger sequence the same
deadline is projected to fall on, at ~5s per ledger).

The two are used for different things:

- **Rejecting operations** — `deposit_to_escrow` and `execute_swap` fail with
  `SwapExpired` once the timestamp passes `expires_at + grace_period_seconds`. A
  rejection is reversible (the escrow stays refundable), so the timestamp alone is
  enough. The grace period covers the delay between transaction submission and ledger
  inclusion, so a transaction submitted just inside its deadline is not falsely
  expired.
- **Confirming an expiry** — `expire_swap` and `cleanup_expired_swaps` additionally
  require `ledger_tolerance_blocks` ledgers to close past `expires_at_ledger`, so
  neither a drifting timestamp nor an unusually slow stretch of ledger closes can
  force an irreversible refund on its own. Until both clocks agree they return
  `NotYetExpired`.

Escrow can never be locked indefinitely. Each `EscrowHolding` carries
`escrow_expires_at` (swap expiry + grace + `escrow_buffer_seconds`); past that point
`reclaim_expired_escrow` returns the assets to their depositors regardless of swap
state and regardless of the ledger-sequence check. Every refund path marks
`released_at`, so the several entrypoints (cancel, expire, cleanup, reclaim,
emergency) can be called in any order without paying a holder twice.

`SwapExpired` and `SwapAutoRefunded` events are emitted for off-chain monitoring of
timeout-driven refunds.

`cleanup_expired_swaps` and `expire_swap` respect the pause circuit breaker, like
`cancel_transaction`. `reclaim_expired_escrow` deliberately does not: it is a
last-resort recovery path like `emergency_withdraw`, and gating it would let a paused
contract hold deposits past every deadline.

Timeout error codes live in a separate `SwapTimeoutError` enum (`SwapExpired`,
`NotYetExpired`, `SwapAlreadyFinalized`, `InvalidSwapDuration`,
`InvalidTimeoutConfig`) because `SettlementError` is at the 50-case spec limit. They
are converted into `SettlementError` at the contract boundary — `SwapExpired` surfaces
as `TransactionExpired`, `NotYetExpired` as `InvalidState`, `SwapAlreadyFinalized` as
`InvalidTransactionState`, `InvalidSwapDuration` as `InvalidAmount`.

The policy is set by `SwapTimeoutConfig`, supplied at `initialize()` or updated by the
admin via `update_swap_timeout_config()`:

| Field | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_swap_duration` | 30 days | Ceiling on a swap's lifetime |
| `default_swap_duration` | 7 days | Applied when a caller passes a 0 timeout |
| `grace_period_seconds` | 300 | Ledger-inclusion latency tolerance |
| `ledger_tolerance_blocks` | 5 | Ledgers past projected expiry before confirming |
| `escrow_buffer_seconds` | 86400 | Added to swap expiry for the escrow backstop |
